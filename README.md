# 1861 Life On The Battlefield Board Game

This game was developed in a group of three people for a game design course.
It is a strategy board game with survival and resource-collecting elements
to it, and our key idea for making this game was to create a game in a war setting
where fighting may not be the most optimal choice. One player is a soldier on
one side, the other controls four civilians on the other side. I created all the
trackers, wrote the majority of the rulebook and reformatted it multiple times,
and played a large role in the overal design process.
